# Thuso2Jcore

This project is adapted from an earlier project named Thuso which was built on Nest.js.

Thuso is a whatsapp chatbot for businesses meant to provide an affordable option for businesses looking to leverage AI
in their operations to streamline customer interactions. The service offers a customisable whatsapp chatbot to address
customer enquiries timely, track customer interactions and interests and showcase products and services. It also allows
the business to leverage the whatsapp business api to sent bulk messages in a manner that does not breech Meta policies.

The project has been moved from Typescript to Java for better robustness and stability.
