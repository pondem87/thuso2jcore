# Thuso2Jcore

This project is a rewrite of Thuso which was built on Nest.js framework with typescript.

Thuso is a whatsapp chatbot for businesses meant to provide an affordable option for businesses looking to leverage AI
in their operations to streamline customer interactions. The service offers a customisable whatsapp chatbot to address
customer enquiries timely, track customer interactions and interests and showcase products and services. It also allows
the business to leverage the whatsapp business api to sent bulk messages in a manner that does not breech Meta policies.

The project has been reengineered to improve maintainability and reliability. The previous project was plagued with God
classes, untraceable interdependencies and side effects and difficult to trace requirements. This project is therefore not
a rewrite but a reengineering effort. The project follows Software Engineering processes from requirements to use-cases
and domain modelling to analysis classes and design classes to implementation and testing.
